> Fuck bitcoin hit two dollars a coin.

Finally, it happened, the entire crypto market has hit the ground. In the world where bots do most of the trading, price fluctuation of buying and selling happens at a fraction of a second. No one knows why the bots buy, no one knows why the bots sell. In the matter of a few minutes while you were at the bathroom, now all that crypto is just ambiguous meaningless bytes somewhere in the cloud.

People been hearing about the news of a cryptocurrency crash approaching for the last few months, but actually it didn’t seem like it was happening. So what would actually happen after the bitcoin crash?

Besides the fact there will be hundreds of thousands of miserable people who invested late in the market, now we are left with these enormous infrastructures that used to mine cryptocurrency, suddenly becoming obsolete. Now something truly interesting happens.

The entire world now has an abundance of graphic cards in the market. Miners will try to get rid of the now useless power sucking graphic cards. AWS and other cloud computing companies would probably be very interested in acquiring these graphic cards at a cheap cost. Some mining companies might even change and become its own cloud computing company after all.

Suddenly, with super cheap graphic card prices everywhere, no one is interested in new graphic cards. You can just purchase 3,4 Nvidia 1080s and connect them to your desktop still cheaper and stronger than the new cards. AMD and Nvidia stock prices will drop soon after.

But with super cheap graphic cards, interesting markets will start to flourish. Similar example is when storage became very cheap, dropbox like services made online storage possible, google provides near unlimited storages, and the world shared petabytes of video on youtube everyday without a cost.

I think that is when better graphic intense gaming, applications will start developing on a serious level. It could be the beginning of a true virtual reality and augmented reality world. Computer vision will be in the hands of millions of companies making something unimaginable at a scale of magnitudes of what it is now.
